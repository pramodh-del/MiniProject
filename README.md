This repository contains the code for a mini-project simulating a movie ticket booking system using conditional statements. The project is designed to demonstrate the implementation of various conditional statements like if, else,  within a real-world scenario.

Project Functionality:

Users can choose from a selection of available movies and showtimes.
Based on their selection, users can choose the number of tickets and preferred seating (if applicable).
The system calculates the total ticket cost based on the chosen movie, showtime, number of tickets, and seat type.
Users can choose their preferred payment method and proceed with the booking.
Upon successful booking, a confirmation message is displayed with the booking details.

Technologies Used:
Java Programming

Running the Project:
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install any required dependencies.
Run the java file (movieticketfinal.java).
Follow the on-screen instructions to choose your movie, showtime, day,membership.

Conditional Statements in Action:
This project showcases the use of various conditional statements in action:
if statements are used to check user input, validate selections, and apply discounts based on specific criteria.
else statements handle alternative scenarios and provide appropriate error messages.
switch cases can be used to handle different movie categories or seat types with specific pricing calculations.

Potential Enhancements:
Implement user registration and login functionality.
Integrate with a payment gateway for real-time booking and payment processing.
Add features like seat selection visualization, movie trailers, and user reviews.

Learning Outcomes:
By working on this project, you will gain practical experience in:
Applying conditional statements in a practical problem-solving context.
Designing user interfaces and interactions for a booking system.
Understanding basic software development principles like modularity and code reusability.
We encourage you to fork this repository, experiment with the code, and add your own enhancements to further improve the functionality and features of the movie ticket booking system.

Happy coding!
